Wacom Intuos Pro managing scripts

This is a set of scripts to set up and customize Wacom Intuos Pro tablets under
Linux/X11/udev.  Original ideas taken from https://github.com/portnov/wacom-intuos-pro-scripts

Features:

* Setup $USER configurations

* Hotplug usb tablet

* Support of Intuos Pro's feature of having up to 4 modes of "express ring"
  operations.  LEDs on the tablet are switched accordingly to selected mode.
  Two implementations are provided for this feature: one simple implementation
  as Shell scripts, and one more advanced implementation as Python script.

The set includes:

* udev directory:
  * 80-wacom.rules - Udev rules file, which runs wacom-setup.sh script when the
    tablet is attached.  Note that for models other than Intuos Pro M, you will
    need to change idProduct parameter. Enables unprivileged-user write access
  * wacom-setup.sh - Shell script which to the file under /sys/bus/usb/ hierarchy,
    which is responsible for toggling LEDs on the tablet (near the ring).

* shell scripts:
  * wacom-switch-mode.sh - Shell script which toggles ring mode: 0 -> 1 -> 2 ->
    3 -> 0 ...  This script just toggles LED on the tablet and runs the next
    script.
  * wacom-ring-mode.sh - Shell scripts which assigns actions to tablet ring
    touches, according to selected mode. This script can switch only between 4
    predefined modes (bindings are hardcoded in the script). This script does
    not care of tablet profile currently selected.
